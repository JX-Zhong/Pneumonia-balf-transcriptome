# Transcriptome data in the BALF of pneumonia patients.
&#8194;We included the original number of read counts for all genes used in the study of "Overly exuberant innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection", the annotation file is gencode.v32.annotation, the genome version is HG38. 

&#8194;Due to the pandemic, our request to release the raw sequencing data has been severely delayed. Once our request has been approved by the Human Genetic Resource Administration of China (HGRAC), reads mapped to human genome will be publicly available in the Genome Warehouse in National Genomics Data Center , under project number PRJCA002273 at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa.
